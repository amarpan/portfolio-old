      <p>Hailing from Apple Valley, CA, Amar has lived the entirety of his life in different areas of sunny Southern California. As a child, he enjoyed reading the dictionary for fun and would frequently get in trouble for "reading too much" and neglecting his other surroundings. Thus, it was no surprise when Amar decided to pursue a Bachelors in English at the University of California, Riverside. However, unhappy with just reading books, Amar supplemented his courseload with an array of Creative Writing courses in fiction, non-fiction, and poetry.     </p>
