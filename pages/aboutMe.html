      <p>Hailing from Apple Valley, CA, Amar has lived the entirety of his life in different areas of sunny Southern California. As a child, he enjoyed reading the dictionary for fun and would frequently get in trouble for "reading too much" during summer vacations. Thus, it was no surprise when Amar decided to pursue a Bachelors in English at the University of California, Riverside. However, unhappy with just reading books, Amar supplemented his courseload with an array of Creative Writing courses in fiction, non-fiction, and poetry. Out of college, Amar followed his second love of teaching and mentoring students, pursuing a Masters in Education and teaching credential from Loyola Marymount University. While teaching, Amar unfortunately grew disillusioned with the public education system, and subsequently found work as a community organizer in hopes of changing the system rather than just being a part of it. Missing his students however, he decided to pursue a role where he could more flexibly help his students as an Academic Advisor.     </p>
