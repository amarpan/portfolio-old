      <p>Hailing from Apple Valley, CA, Amar has lived the entirety of his life in the Los Angeles (LA), Orange, Riverside, and San Bernardino counties of sunny Southern California.<br><br> 
        
        As a child, Amar enjoyed reading the dictionary for fun and would frequently get in trouble for "reading too much" during summer vacations, where his parents were forced to literally snatch his books away from him.<br><br> 
        
        Thus, it was no surprise when Amar decided to pursue a Bachelors in English Language & Literature from the University of California at Riverside (UCR). However, unhappy with just reading books, Amar decided to supplement his courseload with an array of Creative Writing courses in fiction, non-fiction, and poetry, signaling the beginning of a long career of writing in several different fields and modalities. <br><br>
        
        Fresh out of undergrad, Amar then followed his second love of mentoring and guiding others, pursuing a Masters in Education and teaching credential from Loyola Marymount University, located in the heart of LA. After teaching all over urban inner-city Los Angeles, Amar unfortunately grew disillusioned with the public education system, and subsequently sought out work as a community organizer in hopes of changing the system from within rather than just being a part of it.<br><br>
        
        Soon finding that he missed his students, however, he decided to re-approach teaching, but in another, more flexible modality - as a College Advisor and then Academic Advisor with the Boys & Girls Club of Santa Ana and El Modena High School of Orange, CA. <br><br>
        
        While this kept him satisfied for a while, he soon found himself more interested in computer programming and Linux operating systems. Thus, he sought out further fulfillment by going to back to school for an Associates in Computer Science at Victor Valley College (VVC). <br><br>
        
        During this time, Amar was fortunate enough to find a work-study job at VVC's Writing Center, where he got to teach adults rather than high-school students for the first time. <br><br> 
        
        Most recently, Amar continued his love of programming and building apps via General Assembly's 3-month M-F 9-5 Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp. <br><br>
        
        Currently, Amar seeks to combine his love for technology, writing, and teaching by pursuing a role as an Instructional Associate at General Assembly, or as a Technical Writer at a major tech company. <br><br>
        
        In his free time, Amar enjoys playing tennis, working on his book (currently @ 43,000 words), blogging, and playing with his dog, Trixie.       </p>
