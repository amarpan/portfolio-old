      <p>Hailing from Apple Valley, CA, Amar has lived the entirety of his life in several different counties within the greater Los Angeles area of sunny Southern California. As a child, he enjoyed reading the dictionary for fun and would frequently get in trouble for "reading too much" during summer vacations. Thus, it was no surprise when Amar decided to pursue a Bachelors in English at the University of California, Riverside. However, unhappy with just reading books, Amar decided to supplement his courseload with an array of Creative Writing courses in fiction, non-fiction, and poetry. Out of college, Amar followed his second love of mentoring students via teaching through the pursual of a Masters in Education and teaching credential from Loyola Marymount University. While teaching, Amar unfortunately grew disillusioned with the public education system, and subsequently found work as a community organizer in hopes of changing the system rather than just being a part of it. However, missing his students, he decided to pursue a role where he could more flexibly support his students, ending up as Academic Advisor. Finding himself increasingly interested in Linux operating systems and new technologies, however, he sought out further fulfillment by going to back to school for an Associates in Computer Science at Victor Valley College (VVC). During this time, Amar was lucky enough to find work at VVC's Writing Center, where he got to teach his love of writing via Zoom and the Pisces online tutoring platform. Furthermore, Amar pursued the field of programming via General Assembly's 3-month Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp. Currently, Amar seeks to combine his love for technology, writing, and teaching by pursuing a role as an Instructional Associate at General Assembly, or as a Technical Writer at a major tech company. In his free time, Amar enjoys play tennis, working on his book, blogging, and playing with his dog, Trixie.       </p>
