      <p>Hailing from Apple Valley, CA, Amar has lived the entirety of his life living all over sunny Southern California.<br><br> 
        
        As a child, he enjoyed reading the dictionary for fun and would frequently get in trouble for "reading too much" during summer vacations, where his parents would be forced to literally snatch his books away from him.<br><br> 
        
        Thus, it was no surprise when Amar decided to pursue a Bachelors in English Language & Literature at the University of California at Riverside. However, unhappy with just reading books, Amar decided to supplement his courseload with an array of Creative Writing courses in fiction, non-fiction, and poetry, signaling the beginning of a long career of writing in several different fields. <br><br>
        
        Fresh out of undergrad, Amar then followed his second love of mentoring and guiding others, via teaching, where he pursued a Masters in Education and teaching credential from Loyola Marymount University. While teaching in urban inner-city Los Angeles, Amar unfortunately grew disillusioned with the public education system, and subsequently sought out work as a community organizer in hopes of changing the system from the inside rather than just being a part of it.<br><br>
        
        Missing his students, however, he decided to re-approach teaching, but in another more flexible modality. After interning as a College Advisor at a non-profit in La Habra, CA, Amar soon found work as Academic Advisor with the Boys & Girls Club of Santa Ana and their partnership with El Modena High School of Orange, CA. This kept him ______ for a while, but he soon found himself more interested in programming and Linux operating systems. Thus, he sought out further fulfillment by going to back to school for an Associates in Computer Science at Victor Valley College (VVC). During this time, Amar was lucky enough to find work at VVC's Writing Center, where he got to teach his love of writing via Zoom and the Pisces online tutoring platform. Furthermore, Amar pursued the field of programming via General Assembly's 3-month Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp. Currently, Amar seeks to combine his love for technology, writing, and teaching by pursuing a role as an Instructional Associate at General Assembly, or as a Technical Writer at a major tech company. In his free time, Amar enjoys play tennis, working on his book, blogging, and playing with his dog, Trixie.       </p>
