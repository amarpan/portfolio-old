      Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to collaborate with Amar on several projects - big and small.
       He is someone you can truly rely on for support during project week and to solve complex technical problems together.
       His teaching side shined through with empathy towards his fellow colleagues.
       I also love learning and reading his articles on medium because it connects the dots from what he is writing about to what he is practicing in the software engineering world.

      Hard-working and patient, Amar was a pleasure to get to know and work with.
      I was able to experience first-hand the dedication he puts into his work as well as the support he is willing to give to his peers. 
      Always being open to helping others while still being able to prioritize his own assignments, he constantly reached above the minimum requirements to get better end results. 
      Having received direct help from Amar on a project, I can confidently say that he is someone I have been blessed to have worked with together and know that he would be a positive addition to any other team he integrates into in the future.

      I got to know Amar through our software engineering immersive bootcamp at General Assembly.
      Amar can be characterized as our charismatic fearless leader who is consistently ahead of the curve and always ready to assist others in bringing them up to speed. 
      The points he raises during our lessons are insightful and has helped our class gain a deeper understanding of the material.
      His ability to motivate and bring out the best in others is one of his greatest qualities.
      He is clearly dedicated to the craft and has the skills and determination to ensure the success of any project or task.
      I consider myself very fortunate to have worked with Amar and I am confident he would be a great asset to your organization, not just as an exceptional software developer, but also as one of the most genuine people you will ever meet.
