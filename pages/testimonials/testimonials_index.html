      I got to know Amar through our software engineering immersive bootcamp at General Assembly.
      Amar can best be characterized as our charismatic fearless leader who is consistently ahead of the curve and always ready to assist others in bringing them up to speed. 
      The points he raises during our lessons are insightful and has helped our class gain a deeper understanding of the material.
      His ability to motivate and bring out the best in others is one of his greatest qualities.
      He is clearly dedicated to the craft and has the skills and determination to ensure the success of any project or task.
      I consider myself very fortunate to have worked with Amar and I am confident he would be a great asset to your organization, not just as an exceptional software developer, but also as one of the most genuine people you will ever meet.

      I’ve had the opportunity to collaborate with Amar on several projects - big and small.
       He is someone you can truly rely on for support during project week and to solve complex technical problems together.
       His teaching side shined through with empathy towards his fellow colleagues.
       I also love learning from and reading his articles on Medium because they connect the dots from what we are learning to real-world software engineering best practices.

      Hard-working and patient, Amar was a pleasure to get to know and work with.
      I was able to experience first-hand the dedication he puts into his work as well as the support he is willing to give to his peers. 
      Always being open to helping others while still being able to prioritize his own assignments, he constantly reached above the minimum requirements to get better end results. 
      Having received direct help from Amar on a project, I can confidently say that he is someone I have been blessed to have worked with together and know that he would be a positive addition to any other team he integrates into in the future.

      It was a pleasure working with Amar.
      He is very friendly, reliable, and a team player.
      His front-end web development skills are very inspirational and seeing his progress throughout our program was incredible!
      I fully recommend Amar to any development team looking for a reliable front-end developer.

      Amar and I studied and collaborated remotely during our three-month programming bootcamp, where we worked through a variety of different projects.
      From coding challenges, to learning new frameworks or concepts, to developing full projects both individually and in a team environment, Amar has always had a very passionate and productive work ethic that set him forward.
      He was quick to adapt and talk through the process of what we were learning or doing in order to get code functioning and, in moments of struggle, there was never any hesitation to ask questions and reach out, showing that he is willing to grow continuously as a programmer and developer.
      Everything he worked on showed the dedication, functionality, and design of his work being upmost priority and showcased how much he's grown in the three months we were in the program.
      I recommend Amar as someone who knows how to communicate, learn, teach, and be an efficient and strong teammate and developer.

      I’ve been fortunate enough to support Amar as his Career Coach ever since he started the Software Enginerring Immersive programming bootcamp in August 2021.
      Throughout the course, I was impressed with Amar’s thoughtful and insightful questions that highlighted his critical thinking skills and teaching acumen.
      This, coupled with his solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, proved that he was one of the strongest students in his course.
      In one teaching interaction I observed, I appreciated his calm yet humorous approach in successfully debugging his classmates’s project.
      I am certain that he will excel in his career as a software engineer, especially in roles that highlight his strong technical skills and teaching/mentoring expertise such as Technical Writer, Front-End Developer, and Learning and Development Coordinator.
      For any future employer reading this, he is the ideal candidate: a strong developer who builds a strong working community.

      While Amar and I were attending General Assembly’s Software Engineering Immersive course in late 2021, I took notice of his keenness in assessing the needs of others.
      When any of the instructors explained a new web development concept or convention, Amar was among the first to ask a follow-up question, typically for the benefit of the entire class.
      Amar, myself, and one other student were also the only Linux users in our cohort, whereas the other dozen or so were on Mac.
      Amar was frequently the first to speak up when certain instructions given would not work in the Linux terminal.
      While interacting with Amar, I took notice of his easygoing personality.
      He often used lighthearted humor in conversation and knowledge-sharing.
      Because I can personally attest to Amar’s sense for the needs of others and kind personality, I would consider him a premium technical writer candidate.

      Amar's personality is like a warm fire - he puts one at ease almost immediately!
      Also, he never embarrasses his students, and is very humble and patient as a teacher!
      You cannot help but like him!
      He basically saved my life last summer, with his invaluable instruction and personal touch, at Victor Valley College's Writing Center.
      I wish I had him as my own personal tutor because, with his help, I believe I could learn anything.
      In my honest opinion, he was the best thing that ever happened to VVC's Writing Center, because no one else besides Amar took the time and care needed to help me process new information.
      As such, I believe his potential is unlimited and fully recommend him for his amazing teaching and writing skills.

      Mr. Panjwani has proven time and time again to be a very competent and creative teacher, consistently displaying the skills of a very effective educator and leader.
      His demeanor while teaching, and the way he interacts with students and colleagues are commendable and exemplary.
      Mr. Panjwani demonstrates the work ethic and passion that it takes to be a lead or master teacher.
      He exhibits leadership qualities daily, is a team player, and always maintains a very pleasant learning environment for all his students.
      Mr. Panjwani consistently raises the level of work and expectations for every student that he encounters, and is an incredible asset to the field of education.
      It is with the highest confidence in his teaching and mentoring abilities that I recommend Mr. Panjwani.

      One of the most important areas of growth I have seen with Amar is his ability to develop relationships with students.
      Because Amar started teaching halfway through the year, he had no relationships with our students at the beginning.
      However, Amar was persistent and continued working hard to prove to students he was invested in their success.
      He implemented a grading system that allowed students multiple chances to retake assessments and stayed late countless afternoons during after-school tutoring proctoring these.
      As the school year progressed I saw students becoming more connected to him as they realized that he genuinely cared about them.
      Being able to build relationships with students is vital for teaching success and Amar certainly succeeds in this area.
      Amar has also gained strong classroom management skills over the school year.
      He now has a strong presence while teaching, and is able to effectively control his classes at all times.
      Amar has proven that he knows how to work hard, connect with students, manage class, and plan lessons.
      Additionally, he accepts feedback well and values coaching. 
      Amar has the potential to quickly develop into a great teacher.

      Seldom does one come across a young man as qualified and motivated as Amar Panjwani.
      In my 34 years in the classroom and 14 years providing college counseling to students, I have yet to come across someone with Amar's breath of experience, having worked with mainstream, ELL, college bound, and international students.
      Amar's resume and prior work proves that he can adapt to the different needs and experiences of multiple classroom environments.
      Recently, Amar joined our college counseling volunteer staff, where he came in already knowing how to assist students with college admissions and financial aid applications.
      Right away, he started working with students and parents and, in a very short time, has become a vital and valuable part of our work and missin.
      I strongly recommend Amar for any teaching or mentoring positions.
