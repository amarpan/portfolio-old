      I’ve had the opportunity to collaborate with Amar on several projects - big and small.
       He is someone you can truly rely on for support during project week and to solve complex technical problems together.
       His teaching side shined through with empathy towards his fellow colleagues.
       I also love learning and reading his articles on medium because it connects the dots from what he is writing about to what he is practicing in the software engineering world.

      Hard-working and patient, Amar was a pleasure to get to know and work with.
      I was able to experience first-hand the dedication he puts into his work as well as the support he is willing to give to his peers. 
      Always being open to helping others while still being able to prioritize his own assignments, he constantly reached above the minimum requirements to get better end results. 
      Having received direct help from Amar on a project, I can confidently say that he is someone I have been blessed to have worked with together and know that he would be a positive addition to any other team he integrates into in the future.

      I got to know Amar through our software engineering immersive bootcamp at General Assembly.
      Amar can be characterized as our charismatic fearless leader who is consistently ahead of the curve and always ready to assist others in bringing them up to speed. 
      The points he raises during our lessons are insightful and has helped our class gain a deeper understanding of the material.
      His ability to motivate and bring out the best in others is one of his greatest qualities.
      He is clearly dedicated to the craft and has the skills and determination to ensure the success of any project or task.
      I consider myself very fortunate to have worked with Amar and I am confident he would be a great asset to your organization, not just as an exceptional software developer, but also as one of the most genuine people you will ever meet.

      It was a pleasure working with Amar.
      He is very friendly, reliable, and a team player.
      His capabilities at front end development are very inspirational and seeing his progress throughout our program was incredible!
      I fully recommend Amar to any development team looking for a reliable front-end developer.

      Amar and I studied and collaborated remotely during our three-month programming bootcamp and worked through a variety of different projects.
      From coding challenges, to learning new frameworks or concepts, to developing full projects both individually and in a team environment, Amar has always had a very passionate and productive work ethic that set him forward.
      He was quick to adapt and talk through the process of what we were learning or doing in order to get code functioning and in moments of struggle, there was never any hesitation to ask questions and reach out, showing that he is willing to grow continuously as a programmer and developer.
      Everything he worked on showed the dedication, functionality, and design of his work being upmost priority and showcased how much he's grown in the three months we were in the program.
      I recommend Amar as someone who knows how to communicate, learn, teach, and be an efficient and strong teammate and developer.

      I’ve been fortunate to support Amar as his Career Coach ever since he started the SEI Remote Immersive on August 2021.
      Throughout the course, I was impressed with Amar’s thoughtful and insightful questions that highlighted his critical thinking skills and teaching acumen.
      This coupled with his solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and Javascript proved that he was one of the strongest students in his course.
      In one interaction I observed with his colleague, I appreciated his calm yet humorous approach in successfully debugging his colleague’s project.
      I am certain that he will excel in his career as a software engineer, especially in roles that highlight his strong technical skills and teaching/mentoring expertise such as Technical Writer, Front-End Developer, and Learning and Development Coordinator.
      For any future employer reading this, he is the ideal candidate: strong developer who builds a strong working community.

      While Amar and I were attending General Assembly’s Software Engineering Immersive course in late 2021, I took notice of his keenness in assessing the immediate needs of himself and others.
      When any of the instructors explained a new web development concept or convention, Amar was among the first to ask a follow-up question, typically for the benefit of the entire class.
      Amar, myself, and one other student were also the only Linux users in our cohort, whereas the other dozen or so were on Mac.
      Amar was frequently the first to speak up when certain instructions given would not work in the Linux terminal.
      While interacting with Amar, I took notice of his easygoing personality.
      He often used lighthearted humor in conversation and knowledge-sharing.
      Because I can personally attest to Amar’s sense for the needs of others and kind personality, I would consider him a premium technical writer candidate.
